# Welcome
Welcome to my Github open-source webpage. It is a page of wonder where you will find some of my major projects. I have either made these on my own, used help from the internet, or collaborated on these with some of my friends. Take a look at my [Github Profile](https://github.com/CodeMaster7000) and my [Github Gist Profile](https://gist.github.com/CodeMaster7000) to see all of my projects!

# Summary of 2021 and My Future Ambitions
As of December 2021, my coding journey has been fruitful. I have progressed from beginner's level Python to coding several intermediate and advanced games. I have also learnt a significant amount of JavaScript and have made some of my games (such as Snake and the Memory Game) in JavaScript as well. In addition, I have embarked on my CAD journey and can do it at an advanced beginner level. However, I aim to do much more than this. With the advent of the New Year, I want to begin developing my own products from scratch, rather than rsimply ecreating existing games in Python and JavaScript. My friend [(SmashedFrenzy16)](https://github.com/SmashedFrenzy16) has developed Pytoolsuite, Donut Emulator and Game_File_Hub. I am inspired by this and aim to create my own products that will bring simplicity and ease to developers.
